You are hired by John Hammond from Jurassic Park. How would you have designed his park differently to avoid a dinosaur catastrophy?,Neutrual,0,Question,100.0,,,,,How would you design this park or what changes would you make?

Go!!,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,83.33333333333334
,,,,,Real walls.   You can view the bigger animals from the tops of the walls... gives a better view anyway.  For the smaller ones or up-close viewing just use thick glass.   Like real zoos.   These are all solved problems. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,Doesn t even need to be a bunker any moderately strong building with a bit of thought to entrance security and a few reinforced doors would be fine.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,This always bothered me. You re dealing with animals that dwarf the largest modern land animals by several orders of magnitude and the best they could come up with were big game rifles and tranquilizers. I get that they assumed they thought they would be dealing with big dumb animals but even from a veterinary standpoint it tells me that they expected to be able to deliver an effective dose of a tranquilizer to a brontosaurus with darts that fit in a hunting rifle. It s like they blew all their budget on creating the animals and rides but let someone s brother-in-law handle containment and contingency planning. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,From Wikipedia...  Tyrannosaurus - 13 ft tall  hip  40 ft long  head to tail  and estimated 15000 lbs.  African Elephant - 13 ft tall  shoulder  13000 lbs.  That s really not that much bigger.  If we can tranquilizer an elephant we could tranq a t-rex.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,I d say go with MQ-1Bs or MQ-9s instead of attack helos - longer time on station and provide additional aerial surveillance - they were designed as an ISR platform originally after all. Downside is lack of 30mm and rockets but with just as many Hellfires  on an MQ-9 at least  - and option to run a few GBUs.   For something like a Jurassic Park environment I d want 24 7 aerial surveillance of the dinos... but thats just me. It would be a problem during the storm seen in the movie - the  escape  problems are better solved with fail-safe reboot sequences  not the fail-unsafe power cycle that was present in the movie  with redundant power generation capabilities  nuclear geothermal and solar-thermal at minimum would be my suggestion . But for tracking containment and elimination? Give me a Predator. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,   nuclear geothermal and solar-thermal at minimum would be my suggestion   We re designing a theme park not a containment facility for an existential threat. You ve already blown the entire budget with the nuke plant alone.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,83.33333333333334
,,,,,Except we want a self-contained theme park that is on an island....  And Hammond  spared no expense .,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,In the books the power was geothermal.,Question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,I vaguely remember that but I stand by going nuclear first geothermal second as a backup system. Higher power output capability scalable and 24 7 without constant need of supply chain of fuel. I d say scale the emergency systems so that they re able to be supported 100  by the geothermal but use a thorium or pebble bed nuke plant as the primary source.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,83.33333333333334

,,,,,But this problem is this is a movie. You best be ready for when Raptors hack your drone. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Coming at this from an engineering stand point with the major specification being : the animals must not be able to escape and create a fetal population. I think since the variables that allow for escape are too unknown for beasts with literally no behavioral study available that the best option for the large dangerous animals is to employ a form of explosive collars. They would have just enough poop to sever the animal spine  if the spine were made of structural steel as a safety factor  but not blow up anyone nearby at least using a shaped charge that does not produce outward shrapnel. They would utilize only basic analog electronics to prevent any kind of hacking where it has only the simple function of activating if it either recieves a kill signal  manually activated or activated by getting close to regions of the facility that broadcast the kill signal continuously like a safe zone  or if it loses signal from a dead man broadcaster i.e. If the facility losses all power and backup power  specifically if the facility losses the ability to power the broadcast of a kill signal  the collars will trigger. The latter would be a passive measure that would eventually happen no matter what if a rapid evacuation became necessary. The collars would be powered only through the inductance of the Deadman broadcast only needing juice to hold back a small latch that holds a larger latch that holds a larger latch that holds a firing mechanism back so the default action is to go off if unpowered. Only being able to be deactivated by insertion of a physical key.  Along with this surgical sterilization at birth would be mandatory. Seamen could still be extracted from incapacitated beast animals for breeding purposes but this would prevent un-collared animals from populating in any sort of contingency.   Smaller less dangerous animals could be caged conventionally but would still need to be sterilized at birth. The cages should be always made with thick laminated glass  bullet proof glass more or less  and contain pressurised vessels containing hydrogen cyanide. There would be emergency stations with respirators and nitrite kits  antidote  for employees and visitors to mitigate accidents with the HCN gas. But the cages should be designed to mostly contain any gas venting through scrubbers and tall stacks from the roof. Again the default action of the vessels is to activate without the presence of the Deadman signal and also if receiving a kill signal.   One possible weakness is if a very strict maintenance is not followed by staff. Even with maintenance all parts and components of these systems should be replaced no later than within one fith of its rated life time expectancy.   No cellphones or flash photography. Please do not tap on the glass. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,So facility loses power and off go the heads of all the main attractions? Have fun selling that one to the investors. ,Not a question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,Thought the same thing. These are still extinct animals who I m sure would be studied even as fresh bodies. Maybe use something really potent toxins venom to incapacitate them instead? Even a comatose body might be better than a blown off head.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,You could also sell the bodies to the types of people who buy shark fin soup for boner pills.,Neutrual,0,Not a question,83.33333333333334
,,,,,It s not as crazy as it sounds  well it probably is actually  but hospitals with ICUs have pretty dire consequences of they lose power as well. Typically in critical applications like this you have room sized UPS battery banks that can sustain important areas for a matter of hours  I ve seen these on server rooms even . Hours is not a ton but it s plenty of time for a diesel generator to warm up and synchronize with the phase of the power. So ideally this is only going to happen in a worst case scenario.  ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Simple analogue electronics might cause trouble. It only takes one bored kid with radio kit to blow everythings head off. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,The signal would be used to keep the dinosaurs alive not as a kill signal. Jamming would just provide additional power to keep them alive. It would take a bored kit with a Faraday cage to bag a dinosaur in more accurately.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,I am not sure but if he told me  We ve spared no expense!  and then I walked outside to see Ford Explorers I d pretty much question anything else he told me.  The fail safes were horrible in that movie. If you can walk out of a door and accidentally leave it open  in Jurassic Park III  that s just piss poor planning. The first thing that bugged me was that the entire computer system  It s a Unix System!  was designed implemented and controlled by *one* person. Even if Nedry didn t get killed by spitting hooded dinosaurs what would happen if he had a heart attack and died or fell down the stairs?  There was no redundancy. What happens if the raptors get out? We shoot them. Well what happens if shooting them doesn t work? We shoot them more? Not being able to mate does *nothing* for immediate removal of the animal. *Tactical Shotguns?* that was the answer to an animal that could run at 60 miles an hour  according to cannon  and the best answer they have is a *tactical shotgun?*  No offense but if an animal that has killer claws a mouth full of razor blades and can run 60 miles an hour I want something armored with a fully automatic weapon mounted on the top of it. Even if there is remote triggered exploding devices I still want something that can decimate that animal in a heartbeat.  The Lawyer runs into a bathroom that looks like it could have potentially been pushed over by an angry gerbil. Why are there no reinforced buildings? What would happen if there was a glitch and it left people trapped in the Ford Explorers wouldn t you want to move them to a reinforced building until the glitch was fixed?   Grant and the kids walked a long while and the best thing they could find was a tall tree to sleep in? Reinforced shelters throughout the island be prepared for worst case scenario.  The worst thing they did was plan that everything was going to go *the way it was supposed to*. You **never** plan for everything to go right you do your best to make sure it does but you **always** have a back up plan for when it doesn t. Especially when you re dealing with something as dangerous as giant carnivores.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,  Even if Nedry didn t get killed by spitting hooded dinosaurs what would happen if he had a heart attack and died or fell down the stairs?  IIRC in the first movie the park was on skeleton staff as most had left for the mainland so Nedry wasn t necessarily the only one doing the job just the only one at the time.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,83.33333333333334
,,,,,Nedry still had way too much control over the system. Samuel L. Jackson s character was the park s chief engineer Nedry s direct supervisor and even *he* had no way back into the computer system except to reboot the whole thing. And rebooting those computers required shutting off power to the entire park. What would they do in the case of a kernel panic?,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Reinstall the park ,Question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,The book goes into more detail about Nedry. In the movie if you listen to the conversation between Nedry and Hammond Hammond states that he paid Nedry s people a lot of money for the system. He also says that they ve argued before. Mostly about money. The argument makes it seem like Nedry created the system. Nedry argues about how much he has done for so little money.  So there might have been other Admins but none of them new the system like Nedry. Which to me with how important that system was it raised a big red flag.  Just to be clear I love the original and the third movie. They re go to movies for me. I still think they re good movies.      ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Maybe they shouldn t have been on a skeleton staff for their first dry-run of the actual park -_-,Not a question,66.66666666666666,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Well in their defense they had been running the park  or at least the animals  for some time no one really expected their chief control system contractor to willingly shut everything down  which is it s own issue .,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,, The Lawyer runs into a bathroom that looks like it could have potentially been pushed over by an angry gerbil. Why are there no reinforced buildings? What would happen if there was a glitch and it left people trapped in the Ford Explorers wouldn t you want to move them to a reinforced building until the glitch was fixed?  ASCE 7 Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and other structures.  *goes to Table 4-1*  *Looks at occupancy or use section*  *See s Dinosaur impact load*  *Uniform Distributed load   T-Rexs everywhere*  ,Not a question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,I m pretty sure all the dinosaur loads are being added to the blank placeholder chapters that are currently in the code.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,  The first thing that bugged me was that the entire computer system  It s a Unix System!  was designed implemented and controlled by one person.  He was the senior admin.  The rest of the staff left the island for the storm.  He stayed so he could do his thieving.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Was rewatching the original last night and noticed a bit of dialogue that I hadn t before. John Hammond picks up the phone hands it to the chief engineer and says something like  Call Nedry s people in Cambridge.  I did some research and from what I can tell in the book Nedry works for a software engineering company that was contracted to develop the system so that would mean he wasn t even an actual employee but a software vendor.  I don t run a dinosaur park but during critical jobs that rely on a vendor I usually keep at least two engineers onsite if nothing else so that they can sleep in shifts and relieve one another if needed.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,He created the system. He wasn t just senior admin.  The argument between Nedry and Hammond reveals that Nedry created the system on his own. He talks about how great it is all the lines of code he wrote for it and how difficult it was for him.  Only one disgruntled  person created and knows the code. That s Hammond s fault. He should have nipped all that in the bud before it got to the point it did.  If Nedry was disgruntled he should have been replaced. Why was Hammond willing to deal with Nedry if no expense was spared?  Just to be clear it s still one of my favorite movies.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,IIRC from the book is that Hammond was really a cheap ass.  That every time he said  we spared no expense  actually meant that they did.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,, The first thing that bugged me was that the entire computer system  It s a Unix System!  was designed implemented and controlled by one person. Even if Nedry didn t get killed by spitting hooded dinosaurs what would happen if he had a heart attack and died or fell down the stairs?  I just re-watched the original and the one thing that most stuck out to me was simply Nedry   the IT system. Practically everything was working just fine and the only things that really screwed up were due to the SINGLE IT GUY in charge of everything that *intentionally* took down the security systems and locked everyone else out.  That and why did the most dangerous animal cages require actively powered electrical fences? You couldn t use passive cages like say bars plexiglass or steel cables  also the T-Rex paddock cables looked pretty damn strong enough to hold back a pissed off dinosaur.   Also why give up so easily? That park was still fucking awesome. You make this huge investment and give up because a lawyer and a big-game expert wielding a shotgun got eaten?,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Don t forget the guy that got killed at the beginning! The whole reason for the visit. When the craptastic transfer system for the raptors failed.  ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Yeah apparently their transfer system for their most terrifying lethal creature was the same thing farmers use for transporting cattle.  Ignoring the fact that real velociraptors were the size of large chickens. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,There is actually a raptor that is like the one in the movie it was still enhanced for the movie though. I remember getting into a discussion about it a while ago but don t remember the details.  The size of one raptor was used with traits of another raptor. I think the bigger one was found in the Badlands. That discussion was forever ago though and I ve debated so many other meaningless things  like the entire Transformers franchise  that I ve forgotten details.  Jurrasic Park is still honestly one of my favorite movies though.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,I read up on it recently heh. [Deinonychus] https:  en.wikipedia.org ?title Deinonychus  is more like what is depicted with a size more like Utahraptor. In either case they were both probably pretty stupid animals.  On recent watch I recognized it s a great blockbuster movie for kids but as an adult there was too much  oh come the fuck on!  for me to thoroughly enjoy. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,When I watch movies I kind of shut my brain down if that makes any sense. It helps me relax and it keeps people from becoming *completely* irritated with me while watching a movie.  If a movie is completely horrible and it doesn t allow me to do that I ll just shut it off. There was a movie about 3 people stuck on a ski-lift that almost ended my relationship with my last girlfriend. I think it was named  Frozen . I couldn t shut my brain off during that one I used to work on chairlifts. The movie was horrible from the start and I just couldn t get over it.  Jurrasic Park wasn t that hard to deal with because I ve worked for and with management teams where everyone would have been dead before the helicopter touched down on the island. So the screw ups in the movie to me were still somewhat plausible. Not entirely but somewhat plausible.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,It sounds like you ve been holding a grudge about that movie for awhile now. You should really just let it go.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Which one? Frozen or Jurassic Park? ,Question,100.0,Question,100.0
,,,,,Frozen.  I know different movie same name but why pass up a joke?,Neutrual,0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,That joke went *completely* over my head.  I get it now though so pat me on the head and tell me I did good.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,The first scene in the first movie really drives home the point of terrible fail-safes. They had the big crate with raptors and they pushed it into some sort of concrete port until some light went green. Now normally you d see that and think oh it s clamped in and secured. Nothing can go wrong. However a few seconds later the raptors manage to push the crate back so the lamp was basically nothing more than an  it s flush with the wall  indicator. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,  Tactical Shotguns? that was the answer to an animal that could run at 60 miles an hour  according to cannon  and the best answer they have is a tactical shotgun?  Those shotguns piss me off there s no way an experienced African dangerous game hunter would have shotguns to hunt those raptors. A slug from a 12ga would probably just piss them off. He d have dangerous game rifles. ,Not a question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,I agree that an African big game hunter would most likely have a rifle but at the ranges they were shooting a 12ga slug would probably do the trick.  In most states it s legal to hunt moose with a 12ga and many hunters do. A moose weighs about 3 times what the raptors in the movies weigh  listed at 300 pounds from what I can find .,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,I think at one point in the new movie someone said they had a M1 Abrams on standby. I don t think it would be very effective though. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Rheinmetall 120mm smoothbore gun with HE round or AP round is a very very dangereous thing to be pointed at you no matter how many tons of weight in flesh you might have.  It is something made to kill another main battle tanks with weight of 40t and similliar weaponry while keeping crew safe from getting killed too soon if WW3 would happen and Soviet invaded thru Fulda gap.  Living beeings  current or historic  do not have realistic chance of survival against such machinery. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Right on. The thing is a beast MBT. What I was getting at is that it would be difficult for the crew to maneuver and aim at such a fast moving target that s hopping all around and maybe ontop of the tank or whatever. No doubt if they hit it she would go down though. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Actually not really.  Since RL doesn t have respawns the real military uses aimbots.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,M1 Abrams have some of the most sophisticated automated aiming systems on the planet. They are one of only a handful of armed vehicles that can aim and fire on a target accurately *while on the move*. As long as they can lock the system on to the dinosaur they would have little trouble hitting it even if it was running at a good clip.  If it gets close enough to actually get on top of the tank though yeah they wouldn t be able to do much except drive away. It wouldn t be able to get into the tank though.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,That cannon can penetrate over two and a half feet of solid steel.   The effects of the hydrostatic shock it would inflict on  living organism is almost unthinkable.   Every internal organ would be instantly turned to jelly and there d be an exit wound the size of a person. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,I meant effective in terms of being able to track the dino and actually get a shot off on it. If they hit it it would totally be game over. I agree on that point. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Ah that makes sense well sort of.   The FCS of modern tanks is incredible they d have little trouble with dinosaurs even smaller ones with the coaxial and roof mounted MGs.   In all honesty a .50 M2 would get the job done just fine on any sized dinosaur just a humvee or equivalent would be sufficient. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Yea that s what I was getting at. A more nimble vehicle would be much more effective with a quick creature like that.   For example the dino runs at the tank from the side. By the time they can swivel the turret around to it the dino just jumps over the tank and is on the other side. But the MGs could take care of that. Main cannon would be too slow to traverse I feel like.   But the tank would be impervious to dino attack though...I think. They could nibble the rubber off the treads perhaps? Smother it with poop?,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Traverse rate is really pretty fast.   https:  www.youtube.com watch?v JC1mtAR5uK0  https:  youtu.be f5XUQ2beGfM?t 1m35s  But it doesn t matter much since the .50s will kill anything pretty effectively.

,,,,,Jurassic Park is designed to be a safari more than a zoo which is the source of a lot of the problems already. Safaris are inherently more dangerous because they bring you into the animals  space rather than creating a meticulously designed and cared for space for the animal you can peer into. Of course the wilderness has some advantages  low maintenance!  but we were sparing no expense. So let s shift now to a zoo model located in a nature reserve. That successfully nukes the issues with the hamster balls and electric tour SUVs.   The problems real zoos have today are not different in nature and with only a handful of exceptions not different in scale. Hyena are frighteningly intelligent pack hunters cheetah have the speed and leaping ability of a raptor rhinos are on the same order of power as a triceratops giraffes have comparable heights to Brachiosaurs and we keep all in zoos drama-free. T.Rex is a headache but not much more than an elephant - and the same solutions work especially with modern  protected contact  design.  Though the assumption is as much protecting the elephant from accidentally killing you as dealing with a rampage.   So the structure issue is pretty obvious: walls and moats not fences. Fences are good for keeping people out not animals in - which is more often the problem in a real zoo. Scale said structures appropriate to what s inside. Then make all I grew and egress run by hand with air lock-style doors with interlocks like you see large carn exhibits at a zoo. Don t ever have a single door you need anything but yourself to manipulate.   One of the issues they did address in Jurassic World - hire trainers.  This has been my wife s dream job for years. One day!  Behavioral specialists can do LOADS to help prevent the biggest problems and keep the animals happy and safe as well as make all of the husbandry work easy.  But that has more to do with smooth running than disaster prevention though it will do a lot to help you manage risk.   Notice I have said nothing about the computer system? Good - it has no lines in this play. Monitoring people running the entertainment system and charging credit cards are fine. Safety and security - no.   Last thing - a clear set of rules: if there is an escape you shoot to kill and you make sure there are people everywhere equipped to do so. Zoos have some priorities so that  red zone  animals like giraffe elephants lions tigers and anteaters are to be killed immediately with extreme prejudice whereas something like a parrot you can try to catch. You can sensibly do the same here but since we seem to like absurdly dangerous dinosaurs it will be mostly a kill list and that you will have a lot of weapons held by a lot of people in a lot of places. Don t kid yourself with tranquilizers. Besides these are all clones you can make more. But this is a bright line - you have enough armed people to dispatch every animal in the park in minutes if not seconds.   There is really no substitute for a lot of well-trained manpower - which is where the original Jurassic Park failed. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,I ve put a lot of thought into this since I was kid but first I want to ask which John Hammond are we referencing here the book version or the movie version? There were actually a TON of detailed relatively smart precautions taken in the book that never  or barely  made it to the silver screen such as:  - **Motion sensors and video surveillance equipment cover 92  of the park** all feeding a computer database that keeps visual tabs on the animals ensuring specified numbers are maintained  they never programmed it recognize an *increase* in population which they failed to realize until it was much too late   - As the group is inspecting the island they notice that the island is separated into 6 divisions each division surrounded by electrified fences and roads. But what is *unique* here is that the roads are separated from the fences by **concrete moats** some designated on the map as being up **30 ft wide**! Sally even comments at one point that is on the order of a military fortification! Arnold  Samuel L. Jackson s character in the movie  later explains that they are **never less than 12 feet deep** and even **up to 30 ft deep** for the larger critters **all filled with water**.  - It is noted that *all* of the buildings  not just some  are constructed of **very thick concrete and very small windows** making many of them look like [Nazi Pillboxes] https:  www.google.com search?q nazi pillbox hl en biw 1686 bih 840 site webhp source lnms tbm isch sa X ved 0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIzLP9iJmWxgIVQiqICh2g4gzF   - Fifty miles of 12 foot high fencing carrying **10000 volts**  - An aviary was constructed comprised of geodesic struts that were assumed to be made of aluminum and mesh in the open spaces. Grant figures the **diameter is at least a quarter mile**  - A **lysine contingency** was bio-engineered into the creatures so that if they stopped receiving regular doses of it through their daily meals they would go into  a coma and die within 12 hours  as Malcolm puts it however: [ Life uh finds a way. ] https:  www.youtube.com watch?v dMjQ3hA9mEA    - Everything else featured in the movies is relatively accurate the one thing they left out is that Costa Rica finally says enough is enough [Spoiler]  s  and literally carpet bombs the island into oblivion after airlifting the survivors away  .  **So what would I do differently?**  - First and foremost 12 ft high electrified fences aren t going to do jack with intelligent creatures  this reminds me of deer fences and I have actually seen deer jump them before . If anything they should be tertiary at best. If you have to use the fences **triple them in height and make more than one layer of defense**. I really don t see the moats as much use so use something like an open pit that drops straight down 100 ft or more or elevating the roadways up 60 ft high or more made of concrete that can act as yet another wall system.  - **I would NOT mess around with the security situation whatsoever.** If Hammond mentioned to me  We spare no expense!  ohhhhh how he would regret those words. First there would be a **minimum of three different independent computer systems** that helped control the core functions of the park. Gotta have fail safes.   Second I would instruct him to invest in nuclear power facilities  fortified to nuts obviously  that also could be designed to have fail safes to act as small nuclear weapons in a worst case scenario    forgot that *Lost World* reveals InGen utilized geothermal plants on the islands also it s pointed out below why the contingency plan is a piss poor idea . Lastly each sector would have it s own set of 2-3 platoons  or even company s in the case of the large animal areas  of tactical teams housed in barracks that were fortified to the nuts. This would allow for quick response teams to be available to each sector with available nearby support and a system of check-ins would be implemented within each sector to ensure each team was present and accounted for on a regular basis  I would essentially treat the island as damned military occupation NOT a damned joyride . Each team would be equipped with the latest and greatest military-grade tech that would let them take out a damned aircraft carrier if they needed to.  - I would make the island one of the top consumers of titanium and a close second of high yield strength composites.  - Vehicles that were designed with triple redundant backup systems. A smaller airlift squadron would also be constructed on the island.  - Emergency protocols would be beefed wayyyy up. Multiple redundant supply trains would be established  sea air  to ensure multiple possible escape routes. Also local government agencies would NOT be left in the dark to wonder what the hell was going on until the last minute. IN FACT emergency military operations would be established in conjunction with islands own force protection.  - A lot of other people have already mentioned some great ideas so I m not going to steal their thunder but I agree with the majority of them.  Call me paranoid but I do not like to see a situation like Jurassic Park as it was originally conveyed to be treated by Hammond as his second attempt at a flea circus for kids. These are dangerous creatures with unknown behavioral patterns and it would serve to err on the right side of caution!  EDIT: Just remembered that whoever thought using amphibian DNA in the dinosaur genome project ought to be shot. Hire biologists and bioengineers that can actually remember  Oh hey this species has a history of being able to change it s sex at will.

This is all off-the-shelf stuff you don t need to go all aerospace on such problems. Dinosaurs aren t the only dangerous things if it weren t for functional safety systems you d have chemical and petro process plants blowing up left right and center every other day. It s really a solved problem and you don t need to do anything extravagant to have a level of reliability that such a system requires. It s very different from an airplane where it s infeasible to have for example a backup airframe waiting in case the primary one fails. On an island you can easily have two sets of gates for example - if somehow one completely fails open there s the second one; the island doesn t care about added weight.  TL;DR: Some of the aerospace solutions to safety and reliability aren t applicable to land-based systems with few constraints on weight and size.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,So then what happens when the power goes dark?   Yes definitely have redundant physical systems in place  as has already been mentioned  but what do you do in that scenario with the monitoring animal food delivery containment communication  internal and external  and any other number of vital systems when the there is no power? Hell what if you just need to do maintenance to parts of the computer system?  In the book it specifically mentions that the **entire island** runs through a singular central computer and is setup to operate practically autonomous even without input for up to 48 hours  the dinosaurs would get fed etc.   What throws a wrench in everything is Dennis is the designer of said control system and purposely installs a backdoor  during it s creation for his own whims. Later on he uses this to essentially shut out all island surveillance so he can do his nefarious deeds. The rest is pretty well covered in the movie.  What I was trying to get at was in this case where the entire island operations are automated running through a central control system it just sounds like a practical idea to have one or two extras on standby. I don t claim to be a controls expert.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,It s economically infeasible to have anything large ran by a single computer. Modern cars have dozens of computers in them. An island like that would have tens of thousands - remember that each and every I O module likely has a CPU and certainly anything more than the dumbest discrete I O will have a CPU.  As for power this can be distributed too. As a fail-safe you only need enough power to a gate to shut it and confirm that it has been shut for example. Distributed power systems with local storage and generation  wind turbines battery banks perhaps hydro storage if high ponds are available  is certainly possible even on a scale of an island park.  I m talking more in terms of how it would be done IRL rather than in the story.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Their big problem was that they never field tested their ability to come back from a hard reboot until they actually needed it.  It wasn t literally all one computer but it *was* a centrally controlled system and apparently one with carefully managed uptime.

,,,,,I would have taken the opposite approach to park safety.  Low tech and isolate the visitors instead of the animals.  Construct an underground rail system through the island with stops at large viewing platforms pill boxes.  Keep the visitors centre and accommodation off shore.  T-Rex is the big attraction but if you do away with the smaller predators it would be easy to maintain a food chain balance and do away with artificial population control.  Speaking of predators if you limit it to T-Rex you could safely have open tours so long as they are tracked.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,I thought about this too as that is pretty much the modern conservation method in the U.S.  One of the problems I could foresee is one population getting out of hand quickly and the other not being able to retain it s numbers for both species to mutually survive over the long term.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,Would it be interesting enough to attract tourists? I think your idea is pretty good from a safety perspective but the book specifically notes how underwhelming some of the dinosaurs can be in terms of behavior. For example when they feed the T-Rex it pops its head out from the trees quickly retrieves its food then heads back into the trees  I believe they mentioned something along the lines of  we think it gets sunburn easily  . Another type of dinosaur failed to appear at all during the tour.  In short fixed viewing locations may be safe but they are not necessarily tourist-friendly.

One big thing that Hammond was heavily criticized for in the book was drastically limiting the equipment of emergency responders due to fears that anything   adequate   heavier would risk his precious dinos.  To be honest something like 90  of the book s problems could have been solved by simply euthanizing the raptors from the start. Yeah the T-Rex was a problem but they dealt with that easily enough. And if not for the raptors they d have had a much easier time restarting the backup systems.

Maybe don t take the guy you hired to write the database software for your DNA sequencer and have him write the security software. Maybe get a security expert who has heard of manual overrides?  Real talk InGen was less down to Earth than Nerv and there s something very wrong with that.   Maybe get biologists who can tell the difference between *Velociraptor mongoliensis*  about knee high  and *Deinonychus*  a bit bigger . I know there s a million ways they handwaved that away but as Malcolm pointed out Henry Wu did not know the names of the animals he was creating and he was Head Dinosaur Manufacturer.  Maybe if you  spare no expense  on a large game hunter and he asks for guns you might want to consider sparing no expense on those as well instead of bitching about the expense you didn t spare on the dinos and don t want to not spare again on a new animal.  Maybe spare no expense on a doctor instead of having the nearest trauma doctor *on your island of heavy equipment and large animals* located miles away on the mainland.  Actually maybe just shoot John Hammond. He was a bastard in the books and a bumbling fool in the movies. Bam problem solved.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

Besides we re not talking about something that s never been done. Zoo s exist. Zoo s regularly keep large animals contained just fine. Zoo s keep animals as large and deadly as raptors and every bit as smart without people being eaten on a regular basis. The entire problem with the movie version is that it seems that no one ever stopped to talk to someone who ran a zoo about how to safely contain the animals. A LOT of people were downing stupid pills to make what happened happen.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,Mini-dinosaurs.  The T-Rex is the size of a chicken.  Everything else is based on that scale.,Not a question,100.0,Neutrual,0
,,,,,As it looks like others have mentioned... real zoos use big moats around enclosures for large and dangerous animals like elephants and tigers.  I see no reason why it wouldn t work for dinos; you would just have to make the moat bigger.   We re gonna need a bigger moat.   And honestly they wouldn t even need to be that much bigger unless t-rex could jump.  Tyrannosaurus - estimated 15000 lbs.  African Elephant - 13000 lbs.  That s not that big of a difference in size.  Sure a t-rex is probably more dangerous but elephants can be pretty dangerous too.  You do not wanna be anywhere near a pissed off elephant.  If a zoo can hold an elephant it shouldn t have too much more difficulty holding t-rex.  Honestly something like an apatosaurus was probably a lot more dangerous than a t-rex and would be a much bigger problem for a zoo.  They are a lot bigger estimated to have been 160000 lbs.  If you want a scarier JP movie they should have one of those escape.  Elephants have escaped gone on rampages and killed several people in many instances.  Now imagine that the elephant is 12x bigger.  JP always shows the herbivores as being gentle.  But if apatosaurus get pissed off as easily as elephants do  elephants are herbivores btw  that would be a lot more destruction and a lot more death.  JP movies show the carnivore dinos as the threat.  Yet in real life it s pretty much the opposite.  The animal with highest human kill count in Africa isn t a poisonous snake or crocodile or a lion... it s the hippo  actually it s probably the mosquito if you count all the disease it causes but ignoring biological warfare it s the hippo .  Meanwhile many humans go to sleep with a fairly dangerous carnivore in bed with them lol.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,I posted this as a reply somewhere above first but I guess it should probably be it s own submission.   Coming at this from an engineering stand point with the major specification being : the animals must not be able to escape and create a fetal population. I think since the variables that allow for escape are too unknown for beasts with literally no behavioral study available that the best option for the large dangerous animals is to employ a form of explosive collars. They would have just enough poop to sever the animal spine  if the spine were made of structural steel as a safety factor  but not blow up anyone nearby at least using a shaped charge that does not produce outward shrapnel. They would utilize only basic analog electronics to prevent any kind of hacking where it has only the simple function of activating if it either recieves a kill signal  manually activated or activated by getting close to regions of the facility that broadcast the kill signal continuously like a safe zone  or if it loses signal from a dead man broadcaster i.e. If the facility losses all power and backup power  specifically if the facility losses the ability to power the broadcast of a kill signal  the collars will trigger. The latter would be a passive measure that would eventually happen no matter what if a rapid evacuation became necessary. The collars would be powered only through the inductance of the Deadman broadcast only needing juice to hold back a small latch that holds a larger latch that holds a larger latch that holds a firing mechanism back so the default action is to go off if unpowered. Only being able to be deactivated by insertion of a physical key.  Along with this surgical sterilization at birth would be mandatory. Seamen could still be extracted from incapacitated beast animals for breeding purposes but this would prevent un-collared animals from populating in any sort of contingency.   Smaller less dangerous animals could be caged conventionally but would still need to be sterilized at birth. The cages should be always made with thick laminated glass  bullet proof glass more or less  and contain pressurised vessels containing hydrogen cyanide. There would be emergency stations with respirators and nitrite kits  antidote  for employees and visitors to mitigate accidents with the HCN gas. But the cages should be designed to mostly contain any gas venting through scrubbers and tall stacks from the roof. Again the default action of the vessels is to activate without the presence of the Deadman signal and also if receiving a kill signal.   One possible weakness is if a very strict maintenance is not followed by staff. Even with maintenance all parts and components of these systems should be replaced no later than within one fith of its rated life time expectancy.   No cellphones or flash photography.

,,,,,If you are running a zoo with animals the size of tanks perhaps you should have some anti-tank weapons on hand.   Seriously go to Russia buy up a mechanized battalion worth of 80s era surplus military equipment. Ditch the artillery for some Mi-24 helicopters  because they can do double duty as attack and troop cargo transport . Use the T-72s for hunting big game and BMP2s for evacuating people in danger. All of these vehicle are tracked rugged and available for a song because they are outdated for war fighting.  That 8 tonne T-Rex doesn t look so scary from inside a 14 tonne BMP2 with 30mm AP autocannon. And the 125mm cannon on a T-72 is more than enough to handle anything for many kilometres. ,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,An aggressive nature is more dangerous than any claw or poison. Hippos are ridiculously territorial and will chase you down with passion if you get too close to their lake river -- they don t know accidents only that offense is a great defense. You can walk right next to a  fed  lion and it won t give a shit until you start acting aggressive or run away.  Seems to me that the better equipped an animal is to kill the less dangerous it is if you respect it. Killers are confident they can take you on and don t waste their breath on things with itty-bitty nails and exposed stomachs. Grazers go flight fight at the smallest stimulus and the option they go with can be unpredictable.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,A moat. It s really that simple. Dig a ditch twenty feet deep on the dino side of the fence. The side to the fence is a vertical wall the side facing the paddock is nice and slopped. There is no dino in the park that could make it out of the ditch much less out of the ditch and immediately through the fence. Problem fucking solved. Even all the I-Rex could do is glower at you from down in the trench.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
,,,,,Well if I remember correctly the problem wasn t inherent to to the walls although they should have made them more structurally sound for sure. The problem was when Nedry shut down the system to bypass the security measures to the cyrolab he shut everything down. Then when it was supposed to come back on it never did. In the book they further explain that Nedry super lowballed the bid to do the work and it ended up being way more than he could handle. So I guess I would have hired more computer guys to build my system along with ensuring there is a redundant system in place so that one person can t shut everything down without out it coming back online. That said I m not a computer guy I m a ChemE so I don t really have any idea how that would work.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0

,,,,,I would put  cookie cutters  inside each dinosaur from the novel Diamond Age. These are nanotechnology minature centerfuges injected into the blood stream.  They spin in a vacuum to extremely high speed when activated. Then they go to a second detonation mode where they fly apart. As they do they cavitate inside the body like a bullet fired from the inside. They go from  speed of sound to much slower in a very short space and once they exit the body they are relatively harmless. You just see a pink spiral arcing at from the detonation site as it slows down and then exits the body. You can easily have thousands of these in you and not know it.  Then you just need the dog collar technology with the wire in the ground to trigger and some big walls as someone else pointed out. Maybe some battery powered hand wand activators too but in general.. They lacked N 1 designs.  Point being if I m willing to be ok with dinosaurs existing then I can have nanotechnology too.,Not a question,100.0,Not a question,100.0
